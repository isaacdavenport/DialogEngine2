Then, your toy and any other Toys2Life character will be able to talk with each other! \r\n\r\nFirst, take a moment to think about who your character is, and how they talk. Ask yourself: How does my character spend their time? What makes them happy, and what makes them sad? Is there anything unusual about them that you might not expect based on how they look? How do they talk? Do they like to use lots of fancy words, or do they keep it simple? \r\n\r\nOnce you have an idea about who your character is, you're ready to move on! Click the \"next\" button.",
